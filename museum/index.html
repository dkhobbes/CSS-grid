          <p>The most marketable NBA players are typically guards. Players with the ball in their hands -- explosive attackers with an endless flair to their game. As kids look up to and spend endless hours in front-yard hoops emulating their every move, brands are left constantly looking for the next great athletes who can translate into equally great endorsers.</p>

          <p>Dennis Smith Jr. checks all of those boxes, leading Under Armour to sign the Dallas Mavericks rookie point guard and No. 9 overall 2017 draft pick to a three-year footwear and apparel endorsement deal worth as much as $2 million per year with incentives, according to sources. The brand plans to incorporate him immediately as one of its key featured basketball players right out the gate.</p>

The majority of the players selected among the top 10 picks -- save for Lonzo Ball's unique Big Baller Brand venture -- each signed their endorsement deals during the month of June.</p>
